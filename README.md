# dynamic_exaggeration
An algorithm for vertically exaggerating DEMs based on peak prominence\


Phase one:\
-Identify peaks in DEM\
-Remove insignificant peaks\
-Calculate prominence of peaks\
\
Phase two:\
-Develop prominence distribution scale\
-Exaggerate elevation based on prominence scale (flatter areas get exaggerated more, dramatic mountainouse areas less\
